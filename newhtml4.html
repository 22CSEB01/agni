                </u></b></div>
        <div>Appearance
Oranges are a citrus fruit that are round and have orange-colored pulp. They have a leathery, fragrant skin that protects juice sacs inside. The peel is made up of two layers: a thin outer layer called the flavedo, and a thicker inner layer called the albedo. The flavedo contains carotenoids, which give oranges their color.
